## Professional Summary

Full-stack Growth & GTM Engineer who builds the systems that turn strangers into users and users into revenue. Combines deep technical execution (Next.js, React, TypeScript, Node.js) with revenue operations expertise (CRM automation, lead infrastructure, product-led sales) to own the entire funnel — from first click to closed deal.

Specializes in working with SaaS founders and solopreneurs to build products that don't just function, but grow. Equally comfortable shipping an A/B test on a pricing page, wiring up a HubSpot automation, or architecting a full-stack application from scratch.

## Core Competency Map

### Growth Engineering

| Competency | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| **Full-stack product development** | Built clintjeez.xyz — a Next.js 15 + Payload CMS + PostgreSQL full-stack application with server/client component architecture, dynamic routing, and edge deployment on Cloudflare Workers |
| **Conversion-optimized experiences** | Designed a split-screen landing page with interactive hero (cursor tracking, physics-based falling words animation via Matter.js), strategic CTAs, and a clear conversion funnel: Homepage → Projects/Blog → Book a Call |
| **Content-driven acquisition** | Built a complete blog system with SEO metadata, programmatic slug generation, read-time calculation, tag-based filtering, and social sharing — all backed by a headless CMS for non-technical content operations |
| **Funnel design** | Implemented a multi-step conversion funnel: Free content (blog/projects) → E-book lead magnet ("Guide to Building Digital Products") → Email capture → Discovery call booking (Cal.com integration) → Paid engagement |
| **SEO & programmatic content** | Server-rendered pages with dynamic meta tags (title, description, OG images), structured content via Payload CMS, and a blog architecture designed for programmatic scaling |
| **Experimentation infrastructure** | Tech stack choices (feature flags-ready architecture, analytics via Umami, modular component design) demonstrate readiness for rapid A/B testing and iteration |
| **Product-led growth mechanics** | Pricing tiers (LeadsPad at $1,200 / LaunchPad at $3,500) with a self-serve discovery flow, transparent process (Submit → Schedule → Proposal → Build → Launch), and async communication model |
| **Performance & Core Web Vitals** | Image optimization (Next.js Image, sharp), lazy loading, edge deployment via Cloudflare Workers, incremental static regeneration via R2 cache |

### GTM Engineering

| Competency | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| **Revenue operations (RevOps)** | Listed as a primary focus area. Understands the infrastructure behind sales pipelines, lead routing, and revenue attribution |
| **Automation architecture** | Core expertise in automation (N8N, no-code/low-code), evidenced by service offerings and technical skill set. Builds the workflows that connect marketing actions to sales outcomes |
| **CRM & sales tooling** | Experience building integrated systems — the portfolio site itself connects content (blog), lead capture (email/e-book), scheduling (Cal.com), and analytics (Umami) into a cohesive revenue machine |
| **Lead capture & nurturing** | Built email capture for newsletter/e-book delivery, booking integration for qualification calls, and a content engine that nurtures prospects through the awareness-to-decision journey |
| **Internal tooling** | Payload CMS admin dashboard serves as an internal tool for content operations — managing posts, projects, media, and user data without engineering intervention |
| **API & integration expertise** | GraphQL API layer, REST endpoints, S3-compatible storage integration (Cloudflare R2), Cal.com embed, Umami analytics — demonstrates ability to connect disparate systems into a unified stack |
| **Partner & marketplace readiness** | GitHub and live project links in portfolio showcase integration-first thinking; Web3/Solidity/Rust skills indicate experience with protocol and marketplace ecosystems |
| **Data enrichment & analytics** | Umami analytics implementation, structured CMS data with relationships (posts → authors → media), and tag-based content categorization for audience segmentation |

## The Combined Growth + GTM Playbook (How Clinton Operates)

### 1. Build the Product That Sells Itself

Clinton doesn't just build features — he builds **growth loops into the product architecture**. The portfolio site itself is proof: every page is a conversion surface, every blog post is a lead magnet, every project card is social proof.

### 2. Instrument Everything

From Umami analytics to structured CMS data, every interaction is captured. This creates the data layer that both Growth (user behavior analysis) and GTM (lead scoring, attribution) need to operate.

### 3. Automate the Revenue Path

With N8N and automation expertise, Clinton connects the dots between "someone read my blog post" and "they booked a discovery call." No manual handoffs, no dropped leads.

### 4. Content as Infrastructure

The blog isn't just content — it's programmatic SEO infrastructure. Each post is a landing page. Each tag is a segment. The CMS makes scaling content a non-engineering task.

### 5. Self-Serve First, Sales-Assist Second

The pricing page, booking embed, and project showcase create a self-serve evaluation path. Prospects can qualify themselves before ever speaking to Clinton. When they do book a call, they arrive educated and ready.

### 6. Ship Fast, Measure, Iterate

The tech stack (Next.js + Payload + Cloudflare) is optimized for speed — both development velocity and page performance. Modular components and a headless CMS mean experiments can ship without full redeployments.

## Positioning Statement

> I'm a Growth & GTM Engineer who builds the technical infrastructure that makes products grow and revenue predictable. I work with SaaS founders and solopreneurs to design, build, and optimize the full journey — from first visit to paying customer — using code, automation, and data. I don't just build products. I build products that sell themselves.

## Target Clients & Use Cases

| Client Type | What Clinton Builds for Them |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| **Early-stage SaaS founders** | MVP with growth loops baked in — analytics, onboarding flows, self-serve signup, upgrade paths, referral mechanics |
| **Solopreneurs** | High-converting landing pages with lead capture, email automation, booking flows, and content engines |
| **Revenue teams at startups** | CRM integrations, lead scoring automation, product usage → sales trigger pipelines, internal dashboards |
| **Developer tool companies** | Developer-facing docs/portals, API playgrounds, self-serve onboarding, usage-based billing infrastructure |
| **Web3 projects** | Token-gated experiences, wallet-connected onboarding, on-chain analytics dashboards |

---

## Key Differentiators

1. **Full-funnel builder** — Most engineers own product OR go-to-market. Clinton owns both.
2. **Revenue-literate** — Understands RevOps, pipeline stages, and unit economics — not just React components.
3. **Automation-native** — Thinks in workflows, not just features. Every manual process is a candidate for automation.
4. **Web3 + AI edge** — Brings emerging technology fluency that most Growth/GTM engineers lack.
5. **Empathy-driven design** — Focuses on "unique and empathic product experiences" — growth that doesn't feel like a growth hack.
6. **Speed** — Tech stack and workflow optimized for rapid iteration. Ships experiments in days, not sprints.
